You gotta go in there, take out the surveillance, subdue the civilians and get me into the patient database so I can ID the guy. With the low security in this place, it should be a nice, clean job. I'll get you out via the roof when you're done. This job is a little shady, brokered through a third party- got some serious shadow-company military industrial vibes, but worth the risk.

Same fucking stuff we stole from Mercy Hospital a few years ago. Whoever we got it for, they sold it to Murkywater and now it's killing him. Knew from the start that was a bad job. Bain did too, but he wanted that Cagliostro manuscript. That fucking book. Should have told him to fuck off, but he said we really needed it for something, and to be honest,  we'd never be where we are without it.$NL;$NL;»Keep the civilians under control$NL;»Find the correct patient$NL;»Escape with two validated blood samples</string>

	Line 17584: <string id="rb1_nmh_cbf_01">Hey. I spoke to Locke. Bain only has a couple more days. Those Kataru motherfuckers saw fit to shoot him full of virus. Same fucking stuff we stole from Mercy Hospital a few years ago. Whoever we got it for, they sold it to Murkywater and now it's killing him. Knew from the start that was a bad job. Bain did too, but he wanted that Cagliostro manuscript. That fucking book. Should have told him to fuck off, but he said we really needed it for something, and to be honest,  we'd never be where we are without it. You reap the consequences of your actions I guess. That fucking book. </string>
